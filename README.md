# Hackathon-22-Agriculture-Project
This project is meant to be used as a tool by farmers in order to calculate and project costs and production yields for their farms. We have scraped data from the John Deere website to gather costs of machinery as well as https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_global_dataset_for_crop_production_under_conventional_tillage_and_conservation_agriculture/12155553?file=26690678. The data set gave a detailed look at crop yield based on numerous factors such as herbicide and pesitice usage, fertilizer use, as well as if the crop was planted using conventional or non-conventional tillage.

Seeds.py is an algorithm that takes in the inputs: crop type, and a minimum and maximum temperature for the area you are planning to cultivate. It ouputs an estimation of yield percentage based on data on  ideal crop growing conditions.
